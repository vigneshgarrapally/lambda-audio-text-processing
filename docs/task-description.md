# Given Task Description

Implement three different Lambda functions using Python: Transcription, Text to Speech, and LLM Text Processing. Each Lambda will call one or two third-party APIs as specified below and return the results.

## Description of Work to be Completed

The engineer will write Python code (which will run in three distinct AWS Lambdas) that are invoked from time to time by pMDâ€™s application. Each Lambda function has different inputs and outputs, and serves a different purpose.

### Transcription Lambda

This Lambda will take as its input a URL of a .wav file stored in S3. It will call a
specified third party API for transcription (either OpenAI Whisper or Deepgram Nova), choosing which one depending on a parameter passed in. Then it will return the text of the transcript created by the third party API.

### Text to Speech Lambda

This Lambda will take as its input some text. It will call a specified third party API
for text to speech (either Google Cloud Text-to-Speech or ElevenLabs Text to Speech), choosing which one depending on a parameter passed in. Then it will store the generated audio file in a specified S3 bucket and return the URL of that S3 file.

### LLM Text Processing Lambda

This Lambda will take as its input some text to process, as well as system prompts provided by pMD. It will use LangChain (via a Layer) to call a specified third party API (OpenAI ChatGPT) for LLM text processing. It should use LangChain LLM mode, not Chat mode. Then it will return the ChatRPT response as text.
